== SparkPlug.php ==

Add the file to your application/libraries folder

In the controller you want to scaffold load the class and pass the table name as a parameter:

{{{
<?php
class Scaffold_test extends Controller {

	function Scaffold_test() {
		parent::Controller();
	}
		
	function index() {
		$this->load->library('sparkPlug', 'table_name');
	}
}
}}}

Going to the index function in your browser will run the scaffolding.  There is *NO* warning, yet.  It just does it's thing, no questions asked.  Read Caution statement at the bottom of the page.

== Scaffold.php ==

This does pretty much the same thing that the CI default scaffolding does

{{{
<?php
class Scaffold_test extends Controller {

	function Scaffold_test() {
		parent::Controller();
	}
		
	function scaff() {
		$this->load->library('scaffold', 'table_name');
	}
}
}}}

Going to the scaff controller will present you with basic CRUD functions generated on-the-fly.


= Caution - when using SparkPlug =

  * Existing files that share a name with the generated version (such as the controller you're calling the scaffold from) will be *replaced*, any existing code will be lost.
  * I highly suggest you make sure the paths the script uses are correct.
  * I am *NOT* responsible for any lost data.
